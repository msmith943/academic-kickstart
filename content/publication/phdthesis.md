abstract = "This thesis considers the propagation of flexural waves through structures embedded in thin,
elastic plates. In a similar manner to photonic and phononic crystals, two-dimensional structures
in thin elastic plates are known as platonic crystals (PlaCs) and can be formed using scatterers
of any shape arranged in any regular periodic geometry. The time-harmonic waves that propagate
through these structures are governed by the fourth-order biharmonic plate equation, in
contrast to the second-order Helmholtz equation which governs wave propagation through other
crystals and media, such as deep water. Here we consider two-dimensional structures which
are comprised of circular scatterers, pins, and arbitrary shapes arranged in a square array. In
addition to these two-dimensional PlaCs, we consider wave scattering by other platonic structures,
such as one-dimensional arrays, finite clusters and single bodies. For circular and pinned
geometries the solution can be obtained analytically using multipole methods, but for arbitrary
shapes this is not possible. Here we outline a solution method for an arbitrarily shaped smooth
scatterer using boundary integral equations, which arise from an appropriate decomposition of
the biharmonic operator. The resulting system of equations can then solved by implementing
boundary conditions at the body edge and using boundary element methods (BEMs). To verify
the BEM solutions we use the multipole solutions for circular geometries, which are outlined
here. For a two-dimensional array of arbitrarily shaped bodies one can construct the scattering
and transfer matrices corresponding to a one-dimensional array, and then search for admissible
Bloch factors. This permits the construction of band surfaces which reveal when Bloch-Floquet
waves can propagate through the array to infinity. We also demonstrate that PlaCs can steer and
disperse flexural waves analogously to light in photonic crystals and elastic waves in phononic
crystals, and we validate this directly using localised Gaussian beams for pinned clusters. For
such pinned structures the solution can be obtained directly using the fundamental solution to
the biharmonic plate equation, and using these compact incident waves we are able to confirm
the existence of a number of interesting diffraction effects, including negative refraction in thin
plates. We also demonstrate that strong energy localisation is possible within the defects and
waveguides of pinned PlaCs, and show a number of analogues to well known optical phenomena
such as platonic polarisers in two-dimensional arrays of arbitrarily shaped scatterers. A solution
is also presented for a single arbitrary body and for one-dimensional arrays of arbitrary
geometry.""
