abstract = "We demonstrate a controllable enhancement in the electrostrictive properties of a medium using dilute composite artificial materials. Analytical expressions for the composite electrostriction are derived and used to show that enhancement, tunability, and suppression can be achieved through a careful choice of constituent materials. Numerical examples with $Ag$, $As_2S_3$, $Si$, and $SiO_2$ demonstrate that even in a nonresonant regime, artificial materials can bring more than a threefold enhancement in the electrostriction."
