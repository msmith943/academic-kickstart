abstract = "We theoretically show that the frequency and momentum of a photon are not proportional to one another at low frequencies in photonic crystals comprising both positive- and negative-valued material properties. We rigorously determine closed-form conditions for the light cone to emanate from points other than the origin of k-space. We also show that first bands can be tuned to originate from an arbitrary Bloch coordinate."
