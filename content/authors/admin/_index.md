I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at The University of Cambridge working on wave propagation through acoustic metamaterials. My research interests primarily focus on the optical, acoustic, and opto-acoustic modelling of structured materials.

I am also interested in the control of wave energy in periodically perforated thin plates and on wave-structure interactions for floating sea ice. Outside of wave theory, I have expertise in nonlinear elasticity for theoretical and industrial applications. I have considerable expertise in the development of numerical solutions for wave propagation problems including boundary element method (BEM) solutions, finite element method (FEM) solutions, and multipole method (lattice sum) solutions.
